## Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Whitespace Normalization ⚠️
**Component:** Diff Engine
**Impact:** Low
**Details:** The `diff` library treats "Hello world" and "Hello  world" (double space) as identical.

**Workaround:** For exact whitespace preservation, use direct content hash comparison instead of visual diff.

**Status:** Acceptable limitation - does not affect core version control functionality.

### 2. NTP Network Dependency
**Component:** Timestamp System
**Impact:** Medium (with mitigation)
**Details:** NTP time fetching requires network access to external servers.

**Mitigation:** Automatic fallback to local time with clear warning in `timestampSource` field.

**Action Required:** Test NTP connectivity from production environment.
