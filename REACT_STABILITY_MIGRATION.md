# React Stability Migration Plan

## Current Issue
- Using React 19.2.0 RC version in production
- Potential runtime issues and unstable API surface
- Risk of breaking changes in production

## Recommended Solution
Downgrade to React 18 LTS for production stability

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update React Dependencies
```bash
npm install react@^18.3.1 react-dom@^18.3.1
npm install @types/react@^18.3.11 @types/react-dom@^18.3.0
```

### 2. Update Next.js Configuration
Update `next.config.ts` to ensure compatibility:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    // Remove any React 19 specific features
  },
  // Ensure React 18 compatibility
  reactStrictMode: true,
}
```

### 3. Update TypeScript Configuration
Update `tsconfig.json` to use React 18 types:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "es6"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Compatibility
- Run full test suite
- Check for any React 19 specific features being used
- Verify all components render correctly
- Test all user interactions

### 5. Update Dependencies
Some packages may need updates for React 18 compatibility:
- `@tanstack/react-query` - Already compatible
- `react-hook-form` - Already compatible
- `@radix-ui/react-*` - Check for React 18 compatibility

## Benefits of React 18 LTS
- ✅ Stable API surface
- ✅ Long-term support
- ✅ Better performance with concurrent features
- ✅ Proven in production environments
- ✅ Extensive ecosystem compatibility

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Test React 18 compatibility in development
- **Week 2**: Update dependencies and fix any issues
- **Week 3**: Deploy to staging and run integration tests
- **Week 4**: Deploy to production

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Revert to React 19.2.0
2. Document specific compatibility issues
3. Create targeted fixes for React 18 migration
4. Re-attempt migration with fixes

## Monitoring
After migration:
- Monitor error rates
- Check performance metrics
- Verify all features work correctly
- Monitor user feedback
